Subject: Purchase Order <br />
Natasya, I have finished making the purchase order for Flavour Supplier. There are two items there and it is based on the instruction of Mr. Kim. But, it’s a little bit confusing for me since I`ve just got information from production department that there are four items that must be supplied. Can you confirm it to Mr. Kim related to this matter? <br />
I also attach the current purchase order. Inform me if it need to be revised. <br />
Thank you.   <br />
