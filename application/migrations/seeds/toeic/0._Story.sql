<br />
To maintain profits and cut costs, airlines have begun raising and applying fees and surcharges on everything from excess baggage to seat selection and travel insurance. <br />
<br />
An innovative and relatively painless way to reduce cost, according to Dhini Putria, Director of the International Airlines Association (IAA), has been the introduction of the electronic ticket. Airlines have cut the cost of issuing a ticket from IDR 100,000 to IDR 10,000, and collectively they save an estimated IDR 3 billion annually.<br />
<br />
According to Ms. Putria, paper tickets are soon to become collectors’ items and museum pieces; the unique paper used to print paper tickets is no longer being supplied to many travel agencies around the world, something that was once unimaginable. A 1990 survey of airline executives asked them for predictions for their industry; while some predicted relatively obvious things like larger planes, and cutbacks in some amenities and services, none predicted that paper tickets would become obsolete.<br />
<br />
The first electronic ticket was issued in 1994. U.S. airlines were among the first to adopt electronic tickets on a large scale; most U.S. carriers have been issuing electronic tickets for domestic flights since 1996. However, in countries where technology is less prevalent, or when international itineraries involve many different airlines, paper tickets are more common. <br />
<br />
Many believe that market forces will make the complete transition inevitable. As the cost benefits of electronic ticketing become more obvious, most airlines are expected to jump on board and fasten their seat belts.');

PaperThree, Inc., a paper and cardboard manufacturer, announced plans to upgrade its main production facility in Tangerang, and noted that the improvements will reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 70% of current levels, use a third less energy, and will also more than double total production. Dimas Aditya, spokesperson for PaperThree, said that the work would begin “sometime in the fourth quarter of this year,” and would take approximately 18 months to complete. The estimated cost is IDR 250 million. “We’re investing in technology that’s more efficient all the way around. It uses less energy, pollutes less, and allows us to produce more. It’s well worth the costs. And while we think the improvements will give us a competitive edge – our production costs will be lower – we also hope that the rest of our industry follows suit,” said Aditya. “We think that our industry as a whole can do more to save energy and reduce pollution.  We’re hoping that our competition will look to us as a model,” Aditya said.');

Dear Ms. Renata,<br />

Thank you for your letter inviting me to collaborate with you. Your book project sounds interesting, and I would be happy to re-work my article into a full chapter – in fact, I have a lot of material on hand that I had wanted to put into the article, but could not, due to History Club Magazine’slimits on length.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I’m engaged in other projects at the moment, which will take me through to the end of the year. The earliest I could take on a new project would be January. I have nothing else scheduled for then, so I would be able to work on writing the chapter full-time. I realize that is some eight months away, and will understand if you cannot  wait until then. If you do have the luxury of time, and are willing to wait until January for me to begin, then please call me at (021) 561-9106, and we can discuss in more detail your vision of what the chapter should look like. <br />
<br />
Again, thank you for writing to me. I hope we are able to work together.<br />
