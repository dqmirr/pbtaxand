This is a slightly sweet spaghetti sauce that my grandmother Laura has been making for as long as anyone in the family <br />
can remember. The recipe can easily be doubled, so you can make a lot and freeze it for later use. In fact, my sister and I <br />
agree it tastes better after it’s been frozen for at least a week!<br />
<br />
MAKES 8-10 SERVINGS<br />
<br />
1 large can crushed tomatoes<br />
4 tablespoons tomato paste<br />
1 cup water<br />
1 ½ lbs ground beef<br />
3 tablespoons olive oil<br />
2 tablespoons sugar <br />
2 teaspoons cinnamon <br />
2 teaspoons dried basil <br />
2 teaspoons dried oregano <br />
4 garlic cloves <br />
1 large red onion (whole)<br />
2-4 tablespoons parmesan cheese <br />
<br />
Cook the meat in a skillet until just barely brown; drain any excess grease. Set aside. <br />
In large pot, combine crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. Add water, sugar, cinnamon, garlic, herbs, olive oil and whole <br />
onion. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, until tomato paste is mixed thoroughly.<br />
Reduce to a simmer and add meat. Add parmesan cheese. Simmer for at least 1.5 hours, longer is better. Remove onion. <br />
Serve over cooked spaghetti or other pasta, preferably homemade. Freeze remaining sauce and store for up to 4 months.');

Linda,<br />
<br />
As we discussed in our meeting this afternoon, I’d like you to pull together the data for our annual report.<br />
Here’s what I need from you:<br />
• Current budget figures for each department<br />
• A list of notable achievements / major milestones for each department<br />
• A summary of each department, based on the above<br />
I will need this information no later than November 30th.<br />
I have just spoken to Jerry and instructed him to make himself available to you (I’ve copied him on this e-mail). This project has a high priority, and we will shift whatever resources are needed to ensure it is completed on time.<br />
If you have any questions, please feel free to see me in my office.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

PaperThree, Inc., a paper and cardboard manufacturer, announced plans to upgrade its main production facility in Tangerang, and noted that the improvements will reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 70% of current levels, use a third less energy, and will also more than double total production. Dimas Aditya, spokesperson for PaperThree, said that the work would begin “sometime in the fourth quarter of this year,” and would take approximately 18 months to complete. The estimated cost is IDR 250 million. “We’re investing in technology that’s more efficient all the way around. It uses less energy, pollutes less, and allows us to produce more. It’s well worth the costs. And while we think the improvements will give us a competitive edge – our production costs will be lower – we also hope that the rest of our industry follows suit,” said Aditya. “We think that our industry as a whole can do more to save energy and reduce pollution.  We’re hoping that our competition will look to us as a model,” Aditya said.');

David,<br />
<br />
I met with Harry this afternoon to discuss your idea. He likes it, but needs some more specifics. Could you pull together some projections for costs, (including materials, staffing, equipment, and space), and an estimate of the lead time it would take to get up and running once a go-ahead is given? What do you see as potential factors limiting the number of orders we could handle? Harry expressed concern that sourcing raw materials could be an issue. What are your thoughts? Also, do you have a sense of how fast orders could be turned around?<br />
<br />
Harry would like you to e-mail the details to him by Friday, if that’s possible. Let me know if I can help you with this.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work!<br />

<br />
The Taylorville Mayor’s office today announced a public hearing to discuss the proposed Balsam Boulevard Extension project. The hearing is scheduled for Monday, January 9, at Nusantara High School, 257 Balsam Boulevard, Taylorville. <br />
<br />
The Balsam Boulevard Extension project was authorized last year as part of Kent County’s Master Transportation Plan. The town of Taylorville, Kent County, and the State will pay for the project, which is currently estimated at approximately IDR 89 million, and will take approximately one year to complete. The project involves extending Balsam Boulevard from Main Street to River Road, with the aim of reducing traffic on Main Street in the Taylorville commercial district.<br />
<br />
Aerial photographs and maps of the proposed extension route will be made available for the public to examine, beginning at 6:30 p.m. The hearing will begin at 7:00 p.m. with a presentation by Marcel Chandra, the Mayor of Taylorville. Representatives from the Kent County and State Departments of Transportation will also make presentations. The public will have the opportunity to ask questions and make comments at the end.<br />
<br />
“If anyone has concerns about the Balsam Boulevard project, I recommend they attend the hearing,” said Dimas Putra, Kent County’s Transportation Supervisor.<br />
<br />
Construction on the project is expected to begin in September.');

<br />
To maintain profits and cut costs, airlines have begun raising and applying fees and surcharges on everything from excess baggage to seat selection and travel insurance. <br />
<br />
An innovative and relatively painless way to reduce cost, according to Dhini Putria, Director of the International Airlines Association (IAA), has been the introduction of the electronic ticket. Airlines have cut the cost of issuing a ticket from IDR 100,000 to IDR 10,000, and collectively they save an estimated IDR 3 billion annually.<br />
<br />
According to Ms. Putria, paper tickets are soon to become collectors’ items and museum pieces; the unique paper used to print paper tickets is no longer being supplied to many travel agencies around the world, something that was once unimaginable. A 1990 survey of airline executives asked them for predictions for their industry; while some predicted relatively obvious things like larger planes, and cutbacks in some amenities and services, none predicted that paper tickets would become obsolete.<br />
<br />
The first electronic ticket was issued in 1994. U.S. airlines were among the first to adopt electronic tickets on a large scale; most U.S. carriers have been issuing electronic tickets for domestic flights since 1996. However, in countries where technology is less prevalent, or when international itineraries involve many different airlines, paper tickets are more common. <br />
<br />
Many believe that market forces will make the complete transition inevitable. As the cost benefits of electronic ticketing become more obvious, most airlines are expected to jump on board and fasten their seat belts.');
