Great news! <br/>
The sales figures for June are in, and gross receipts were IDR 825 million, our highest gross ever! You not only  <br/>
met the sales goal, you surpassed it – and then some! Congratulations, and more importantly, thank you!  <br/>
While it’s still too early to make the call, it looks like we’re on track to exceed July’s goal, as well. <br/>
 <br/>
As partial thanks for all your good work, I’m inviting everyone to the conference room tomorrow at 4:00 for  <br/>
a celebration. I’ve arranged for a caterer to bring sandwiches and snacks, beverages, and desserts. So  <br/>
come hungry, and leave your work at your desk! <br/>
 <br/>
Again, thank you everyone for an outstanding job! <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Dear Mr. Prasetya,  <br/>
 <br/>
We have reviewed our records and found that the correct price for IA50 Advanced Thrusters you ordered is indeed IDR 5,500,000 not IDR 8,000,000 as was indicated on your invoice. <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you for calling attention to our error. We regret any inconvenience this may have caused you. 
A corrected invoice accompanies this letter. <br/>
 <br/>

Dear Ms. Renata, <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you for your letter inviting me to collaborate with you. Your book project sounds interesting, and I would be happy to re-work my article into a full chapter – in fact, I have a lot of material on hand that I had wanted to put into the article, but could not, due to History Club Magazine’slimits on length. <br/>
 <br/>
Unfortunately, I’m engaged in other projects at the moment, which will take me through to the end of the year. The earliest I could take on a new project would be January. I have nothing else scheduled for then, so I would be able to work on writing the chapter full-time. I realize that is some eight months away, and will understand if you cannot  wait until then. If you do have the luxury of time, and are willing to wait until January for me to begin, then please call me at (021) 561-9106, and we can discuss in more detail your vision of what the chapter should look like.  <br/>
 <br/>
Again, thank you for writing to me. I hope we are able to work together. <br/>
 <br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
Pandu Wicaksana  <br/>
